			<p class="right">The kola nut is repeatedly referred to in Things Fall Apart. It is an honor to be the one to break the kola nut and it is said that “he who brings kola brings life.” The blog describes how the kola nut is related to Igbo traditions and provides images of what it looks like.<br><br>According to Vitus Ejiogu, the kola nut represents happiness, love for others, and unity. It must be presented as a welcome to guests or as good gesture for settling disputes. The importance of the kola nut is similar to the American tradition, “never show up empty-handed.” Typically, the kola nut is brought by visitors, broken by the eldest man in the room and then passed around on closest relation. Women are traditionally not allowed to break the kola nut. The artifact can be found <a href="http://kolanutcash.blogspot.com/2011/12/importance-of-kolanut-in-igboland.html">here</a>.</p>

			<p class="left">Sweet potato, was one of the staple food crops in the book. The amount of yams that one has is also a symbol of his status and wealth in the novel. When a person is poor, they are generally lended yams so they could state their own farm. This artifact appeared when Okonkwo was exiled and when he was at the height of his power. This illustrated that a man is always conscious of his yams.<br><br>Growing yams is one of the most labor intensive tasks that the Umuofians had to do. Okonkwo had to get the help from his children to collect the year’s harvest. The amount of yams a man had was also a symbol of his power in the village. A man also values his yams greatly and goes to extents to protect them, like Okonkwo did when he was exiled.

			<p class="right">In African society, most cultures made the future husband give stacks of cowries until the wife or her family is satisfied with the amount. In the Umuofian society, this is pretty much reversed. Both families bargain until a price is reached. They do not believe that women should have any sort of power over a man in the Umuofian society. Cowries are the currency that is used in the society and are used in matters like bride pricing.<br><br>The bargaining is done using sticks. A certain amount of sticks is given to the man’s family and they return with the amount that they feel is appropriate. This process continues until a certain amount of sticks is decided on. This process happened in the book when Obierika was bargaining his daughter; the event was very tense and Achebe seemed to emphasize its importance.

			<p class="left">Chinua Achebe’s Things Fall Apart takes place in Umuofia, a fictional tribe of the Igbo people in Nigeria. The Igbo (referred to as “Ibo” in the book) do not use the Gregorian calendar. In the Igbo calendar, a week is four days, a month is seven weeks (28 days). There are 13 months in a year (91 weeks, or 364 days).<br><br>While the calendar is not incredibly significant to understanding the book, some of the statements make more sense with the context of their calendar. The Igbo calendar is still used by some, and you can view on online version of this artifact <a href="https://igbocalendar.com/">here</a>.</p>

			<p class="right">In Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe, a character named Enoch kills and eats a python in rejection of his previous religion and as a convert to Christianity. This leads heated debates on Enoch’s punishment, whether new Christian converts should switch back to their traditional religion, and how the tribe in Umuofia should deal with the white Christians who have decided to settle in their land and change their customs. The python is described to be a greatly worshipped animal among the Nigerian tribe, and one who accidentally killed a python must give it a proper burial and sacrifice to appease the Gods. This blog post goes into more detail about exactly how the python is related to the Gods and why it is revered by Nigerians.<br><br>Ala is the Earth Mother Goddess of morality, death, and fertility. She judges humans who have committed crimes and can control the success of a man’s harvest. The python is Ala’s messenger on Earth, explaining why the creature is so important to Nigerians. Killing one would mean disrespecting Ala and resulting in your death as punishment.

			<p class="left">The Evil Forest is where the bodies of dishonorary criminals are disposed of in Umuofia of Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe. A woman whose children kept dying soon after being born are said to have been cursed with a child wishing to torture its mother by being reborn and dying again and again, and in the book, this is dealt with by dismantling the baby after it is born to scare it from torturing its mother again. When the new white settlers hear of this, they get an ugly view of Nigerian customs. This article dives deeper into Americans’ impression of this culture by describing news reporters’ reaction from walking through the Evil Forest.<br><br>The reporters walk through the forest where there are bones and decomposing bodies everywhere they look. The Nigerians believe it is what must be done to appease the gods and stand by their traditions while the reporters try to explain their actions are monstrous and cruel and attempt to preach about Christianity just like the white men in the book.

			<p class="right">The Igbo tribes in Things Fall Apart practice the religion of Odinani, a religion that is still around today. While polytheistic, Odinani has a ruling god, Chukwu (or Chineke). The religion also focuses on one’s Chi, their personal god (similar to the idea of a guardian angel). Odinani believes in reincarnation, and has several other deities, usually representing various natural forces. Some of the deities include Ala (land) and Amadioha (sky, lightning).
